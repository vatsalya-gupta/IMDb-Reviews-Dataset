# Sentiment-Analysis-Movie-Reviews-Deployment
This is a Keras based implementation for classifying a movie review as positive or negative. The IMDb-Reviews Dataset is taken from Keras built-in datasets (more info [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews)).

Sentiment analysis is applied on the dataset and in the end, an [external text review](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2284594) is evaluated on the model.

The model is deployed on Heroku [here](https://movie-reviews-sentiment-rating.herokuapp.com/).
