# Sentiment-Analysis-Movie-Reviews
This is a Keras based implementation for classifying a movie review as positive or negative. The dataset used is the sample IMDb-Reviews Keras dataset (more info [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews)).

Sentiment analysis is applied on the dataset and in the end, an [external text review](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2284594) is evaluated on the model.
